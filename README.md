I had the most trouble with this assignment than previous assignments. I kept watching the videos, but I still felt like I needed some basic understanding of JavaScript to complete this assignment. My background in JavaScript only includes what I learned at the very end of the previous Web Topics class. 

I had to get help from a tutor to correct the mistakes I had. I would benefit from an overview of the basics.
